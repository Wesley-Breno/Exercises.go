In this code I consolidated the knowledge I had about arithmetic operators. I demonstrate in practice the use of basic operators to the most unusual ones;

<p>Basic operators</p>
<ul>
 <li>Sum
 <li>Subtraction
 <li>Division
 <li>Multiplication
 <li>Module (Remainder of division)
</ul>

<p>Bitwise operators</p>
<ul>
 <li>And
 <li>OR
 <li>Xor
</ul>

<p>Math package operators</p>
<ul>
 <li>Max (Take the largest value among the values)
 <li>Min (Take the smallest value among the values)
 <li>Pow (A raised to B)
</ul>
