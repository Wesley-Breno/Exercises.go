You have 2 jobs
one on Tuesday and one on Thursday
<br>
You want to buy a television.
<br>
If you get both jobs, on Tuesday and Thursday;
<br>
  He's going to buy a bigger 50-inch television and go have ice cream with his wife
<br>
If you only get one of the jobs, Tuesday or Thursday;
<br>
  You're going to buy a smaller 32-inch television and still go out for ice cream
<br>
If neither of the 2 jobs work out;
<br>
  He's not going to buy the television and he's not going to go out for ice cream ;(
