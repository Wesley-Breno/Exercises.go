Tabajara Organizations decided to give a salary increase to their employees, and they hired you to develop a program that will calculate the adjustments.
Write a program that receives an employee's salary and applies the adjustment according to the following criteria, based on the current salary:

<li>Salaries up to R$ 280.00 (including): 20% increase
<li>Salaries between R$ 280.00 and R$ 700.00: 15% increase
<li>Salaries between R$ 700.00 and R$ 1500.00: 10% increase
<li>Salaries of R$ 1500.00 and above: 5% increase

<br>
<br>
After the adjustment is applied, display the following information on the screen:
<br>
<br>
<li>Salary before the adjustment
<li>Applied raise percentage
<li>Raise amount
<li>New salary after the raise
