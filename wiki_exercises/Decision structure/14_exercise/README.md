# Student Grade Calculation

This program reads two partial grades obtained by a student in a subject during a semester and calculates the student's average. The assignment of grades follows the table below:

| Average Score           | Grade |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Between 9.0 and 10.0     | A     |
| Between 7.5 and 9.0      | B     |
| Between 6.0 and 7.5      | C     |
| Between 4.0 and 6.0      | D     |
| Between 0.0 and 4.0      | E     |

The algorithm should display the grades, the average, the corresponding grade, and the message "PASSED" if the grade is A, B, or C, or "FAILED" if the grade is D or E.
