Write a program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation, in the form ax2 + bx + c. The program must ask for the values ​​of a, b and c and make the consistencies, informing the user in the following situations:
- If the user enters the value of A equal to zero, the equation is not of the second degree and the program should not ask for the other values, being terminated;


- If the calculated delta is negative, the equation has no real roots. Inform the user and close the program;


- If the calculated delta is equal to zero, the equation has only one real root; inform the user;


- If the delta is positive, the equation has two real roots; inform them to the user;
