Develop a program that makes the multiplication table of any integer number that will be typed by the user, but the multiplication table does not necessarily have to start at 1 and end at 10, the initial and final values ​​must also be informed by the user, as shown in the example below: Create the multiplication table of: 5 Start at: 4 End at: 7 I will create the multiplication table of 5 starting at 4 and ending at 7: 5 X 4 = 20 5 X 5 = 25 5 X 6 = 30 5 X 7 = 35 Note: You must check if the user did not type the ending smaller than the initial.
